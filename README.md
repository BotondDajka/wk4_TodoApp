# About
A smallscale web-based Todo application to keep track of tasks that need to be worked on within a team. Users can register accounts and create boards where they can add their team members. On the boards, users can add columns (e.g. Todo, Doing, Done) where tasks can be added to and dragged around as it moves on in phases. Tasks can be decorated with a title, description, and labels and can be assigned to board members
